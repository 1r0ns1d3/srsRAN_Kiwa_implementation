/// \brief Retrieves the resource grid allocator ring size greater than given minimum value.
/// \remark 1. The implementation of circular ring based resource allocator only works correctly if we set a
/// ring size which satisfies the condition NOF_SLOTS_PER_SYSTEM_FRAME % RING_ALLOCATOR_SIZE = 0.
/// The condition is placed to avoid misalignment between (last_slot_ind + slot_delay) slot point and
/// slot point contained in ((last_slot_ind + slot_delay) % RING_ALLOCATOR_SIZE) slot, which occurs when slot point is
/// close to NOF_SLOTS_PER_SYSTEM_FRAME value.
/// Misalignment example: Assume NOF_SLOTS_PER_SYSTEM_FRAME = 10240 and RING_ALLOCATOR_SIZE = 37
/// At Slot point (10238) % 37 = Element at index 26 of slots array/vector is accessed, similarly
/// Slot point (10239) % 37 = 27
/// Now, Slot point wraps around NOF_SLOTS_PER_SYSTEM_FRAME and is set to 0, this causes Slot point (0) % 37 = 0.
/// Resulting in element at index 0 of slots array/vector being accessed rather than index 28.
/// \remark 2. The reason for choosing values 20, 40 and 80 for RING_ALLOCATOR_SIZE is because it holds the condition
/// NOF_SLOTS_PER_SYSTEM_FRAME % RING_ALLOCATOR_SIZE = 0. for all numerologies.
